# Analysis of young people in Mexico
This document presents public data on Youth Opportunity in Mexico City. The information is in Spanish because the client is Mexican but you will find a small summary of each sheet below.

## Goal
The purpose of the dashboard was to analyze young people between the ages of 15 and 29 in, specifically, Mexico City in order to find vulnerable sectors and be able to create initiatives that help them.

## Results
With the information we obtained, initiatives could be implemented to help young people who do not study or work to get ahead.

## Duration
The data analysis project lasted approximately two months since the sources used are diverse and some of them were not in tabular format. So there is an exhaustive work of data transformation
